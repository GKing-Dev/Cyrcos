    "# Cyrcos: Circos-esque Figures using Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Cyrcos is a very limited Python implementation of Circos-like chord graphs created via Matplotlib! See http://circos.ca for the real deal, which I have nothing to do with and is better in every way :) I made Cyrcos because I wanted to make very specific types of chord-graph figures for comparing immune repertoire datasets from differet cell subsets within a single donor. The format for input data can be either a specific set of positions to connect or you can describe the relative positions from 0.0 to 1.0 within each group for a specific member.\n",
    "\n",
    "I plan on at the very least adding some more customization for changing the relative sizes for the groups - as things currently stand each circle segment is displayed as the same length. I'll also have a more robust method of providing input via JSON and/or pandas DataFrames soon!\n",
